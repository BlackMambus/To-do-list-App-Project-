✅ To-Do List – Mastering Your Day, One Task at a Time

A to-do list is a simple but powerful tool to help you organize tasks, set priorities, and stay productive. Whether digital or on paper, it’s your personal roadmap for the day, week, or month.

📝 What It Typically Includes:
Tasks: Clear, actionable items like “buy groceries” or “email client.”

Deadlines: Due dates help you stay focused and avoid last-minute scrambles.

Priorities: Mark tasks as high, medium, or low importance to structure your time.

Status: Track whether a task is pending, in progress, or completed.
